## Overview

**Void's Virtual Grimoire** is a digital version of parts of my Grimoire that I have deemed appropriate to share publicly. It consists of correspondences, recipes, DIY instructions, and resources I have found or created for use in my craft. Many of the items listed are of a mundane nature and may be useful to anyone, not just spiritual people. 

The project will make use of React.js, React Router, Axios, Airtable and the Airtable API in order to build an interactive webapp. I will be taking a mobile-first approach, but I do intend to try to make it look aesthetically pleasing and interesting on all devices, with visual assets suited to a Grimoire.

- Displays four wireframes for the mobile version. Desktop will look very similar.

### MVP

The **Void's Virtual Grimoire** MVP will focus on creating a web application that works on small screen sizes, mainly smartphones, without looking or feeling clunky. The application will be built in React.js and it will use Axios requests to GET content from and POST new content to its Airtable database. The content will be organized into categories, which can be used as search criteria or to view only certain types of content.

The project will utilize at least 6 components, some of which may for different pages while others may be reusable code. The project will utilize React Router to link the page components together.

#### Goals

- _Create an interactive webapp to display content sourced from an Airtable database._
- _Utilize React.js to make at least 6 components which will be used to collect and display information from the database._
- _Follow a mobile-first approach to make an intuitive webapp._
- _Navigate objects returned from the Airtable API via axios requests._

## Project Delivery

### Code Showcase

This code handles changing the url used for post axios requests based on which part of the site you're on. It's a neat little way that allows me to reuse the Posts component instead of making a different component to do the same thing on each path.

```
  let url = null;
  if (window.location.pathname === "/") {
    //shows most recent 7 posts in order of newest to oldest
    url = "https://api.airtable.com/v0/appVtcDvltW4WweAs/Table%201?maxRecords=7&view=Grid%20view&sort%5B0%5D%5Bfield%5D=Date&sort%5B0%5D%5Bdirection%5D=desc";
  }
  else if (window.location.pathname === "/posts") {
    //shows all posts in order of most recent
    url = "https://api.airtable.com/v0/appVtcDvltW4WweAs/Table%201?view=Grid%20view&sort%5B0%5D%5Bfield%5D=Date&sort%5B0%5D%5Bdirection%5D=desc";
  }
  else if (window.location.pathname === "/search_results") {
    //this url is passed around from the Search component's generated search url
    url = props.searchurl;
  }
  else { //error handler for url
    console.log("Error: The Posts component has been called but I don't know what to do for this pathname.")
  }```
