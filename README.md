## Overview

**Void's Virtual Grimoire** is a digital version of parts of my Grimoire that I have deemed appropriate to share publicly. It consists of correspondences, recipes, DIY instructions, and resources I have found or created for use in my craft. Many of the items listed are of a mundane nature and may be useful to anyone, not just spiritual people. 

The project will make use of React.js, React Router, Axios, Airtable and the Airtable API in order to build an interactive webapp. I will be taking a mobile-first approach, but I do intend to try to make it look aesthetically pleasing and interesting on all devices, with visual assets suited to a Grimoire.

### Wireframes

> Use the Wireframes section to display desktop, tablet and mobile views.

- Displays four wireframes for the mobile version. Desktop will look very similar.

### MVP

> The Minimum Viable Product should be a well-planned and easily-communicated product, ensuring that the client's deliverable will be achievable and meet specifications within the time frame estimated.

The **Void's Virtual Grimoire** MVP will focus on creating a web application that works on small screen sizes, mainly smartphones, without looking or feeling clunky. The application will be built in React.js and it will use Axios requests to GET content from and POST new content to its Airtable database. The content will be organized into categories, which can be used as search criteria or to view only certain types of content.

The project will utilize at least 6 components, some of which may for different pages while others may be reusable code. The project will utilize React Router to link the page components together.

#### Goals

- _Create an interactive webapp to display content sourced from an Airtable database._
- _Utilize React.js to make at least 6 components which will be used to collect and display information from the database._
- _Follow a mobile-first approach to make an intuitive webapp._
- _Navigate objects returned from the Airtable API via axios requests._

#### Libraries

> Use this section to list all supporting libraries and their role in the project.

|     Library      | Description                                                       |

#### Component Breakdown

> Use this section to go into further depth regarding your components, including breaking down the components as stateless or stateful, and considering the passing of data between those components.

|  Component   |    Type    | state | props | Description                                                      |
| :----------: | :--------: | :---: | :---: | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  NavBar      | functional |   n   |   n   | _The NavBar will provide links to each category, the home page, and contain the Search bar. It will appear in the page Header in app.js._       |
|   Search     |   class    |   y   |   n   | _The Search component will provide a way to search the content saved to the Airtable database via either keyword or category.._ |
|    Home    | functional |   n   |   n   | _The Home component is just the landing page. Displays the most recent 7 posts._               |
|   Posts      |   class    |   y   |   n   | _The Posts component will render the posts using flexbox. It will display either all posts, some posts or Search results in order of most recent to oldest depending on the pathname._      |
| ViewPost     | functional |   n   |   n   | _Takes params to render a single post with all its info._                 |
|    NewPost    | functional |   n   |   n   | _Used to create new posts to the airtable. Has its own page._               |
|    Footer    | functional |   n   |   n   | _The footer will contain contact info and link back to my portfolio._ |

#### Component Estimates

> Use this section to estimate the time necessary to build out each of the components you've described above. 
>
> Time frames are key to the development cycle. You have limited time to code your app, and your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities of your MVP and post-MVP based on time needed. It's best you assume an additional hour for each component, as well as a few hours added to the total time, to play it safe.

| Task                      | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| ------------------------  | :------: | :------------: | :-----------: | :---------: |

| Footer                    |    L     |     <1 hr      |      ---      |     TBD     |
